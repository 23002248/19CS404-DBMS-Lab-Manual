# Experiment 6: PL/SQL â€“ Variables, Control Structures and Loops

## AIM
To write and execute simple PL/SQL programs using variables, loops, and conditional statements.


## THEORY

PL/SQL, which stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL). It is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECLARE 
   <declarations section> 
BEGIN 
   <executable command(s)>
EXCEPTION 
   <exception handling> 
END;
```

### Basic Components of PL/SQL Block:

DECLARE: Section to declare variables and constants.

BEGIN: The execution section that contains PL/SQL statements.

EXCEPTION: Handles errors or exceptions that occur in the program.

END: Marks the end of the PL/SQL block.

## Program 1: Find the Greatest of Two Numbers

```sql
--paste your answer
```

Expected Output
Greater number is: 80

## Program 2: Calculate Sum of First N Natural Numbers


## RESULT
Thus, the PL/SQL programs using variables, conditionals, and loops were executed successfully.
